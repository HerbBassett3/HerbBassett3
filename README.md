- 👋 Hi, I’m @HerbBassett3
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, gardening, cooking, maintaining and protecting native and wild ecosystems, cultivating mildfullness, bad puns, dad jokes, Irish music, peace, and my family.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that reconnect people to nature, show people simple ways to live, and spread information on the impacts of human behavior on the earth.
- 📫 How to reach me: To be decided.
